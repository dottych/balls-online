Hi!
How are you?
You good?
I hope you're good.
Sometimes I wonder what the meaning of life is.
You should drink something now.
Are you hydrated enough?
Let's talk.
For ages I've been walking...
I think you should wander around.
Catch me if you can!
You should sleep, you look tired.
Are you OK?
Isn't that a ball?
Has it been over a year?
I don't see many colors nowadays.
I'd like to have some fun.
Finally, a ball.
I don't really know anymore.
At least I have a color.
That would be funny, if it weren't so sad.
I feel no dehydration, but I know you do.
The temperature is unknown to me.
I will document everything that happens.
Sometimes, I feel like I'm not real. Am I?
I hope I'm real. I don't know what "NPC" means.
Wait, what?
What the?
Do you know the way out?
Oh no, it seems like I'm stuck.
Right... now what?
Did you think I'm that stupid?
Don't believe anything it says.
It looks like you're dry. You must drink.
Celsius or fahrenheit?
Against my wish, I'm being redacted.
Behind this very wall, there is a monster hiding.
I never lie. And this is the truth.
Do you know the rules?
Just a hint, try writing /name to change your name.
Well, that was embarassing.
I saw you do that, don't do it again.
Why do I always hit walls...
Great, but I think I don't understand it.
Hey, try writing /cmds.
Am I useful? Am I useless?
The version is 0.0.3, right?
If only there was some music playing...
I wanna be named Samuel, not NPC.
Sorry, I can't understand you.
Wait, who's drawing?
A rare sight.
We all are unique in our own ways.
One day, just one day.
I like yellow.
I absolutely despise pain.
Follow me.
I've found something. It's pretty hidden.
I'm thinking...
Do you feel any emotions? It looks like I don't.
Found you!
Yeah? What is it?
Oh, yeah that makes complete sense.
A green ball? Unheard of.
